# language-stata package

A language syntax package for Atom based on the textmate stata package (https://github.com/statatmbundle/Stata.tmbundle).

This package includes syntax highlighting, but no tools for executing Stata code.

To execute Stata code from Atom, consider the `script` package in Atom.
